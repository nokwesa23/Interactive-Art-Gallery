This is relevant to media and digital arts because it's interacting with art in a digital format. 

## Features
- Moving through the gallery
    - The user will be able to "move through" the different rooms by using the arrow keys
- Details about the artwork
    - The user will be able to learn more about the art work they are viewing by
    stating they would like to learn more about the piece.
- Leaving a gallery review
    - The user will be able to leave a review of the gallery when they are ready to leave via a
    user input.


## Challenges
- Inputing real artworks into the program for users to view it.
- Having a way for the users to go back and forth throughout the gallery.
- Transitioning between the title screen, art gallery, and closing screen.


## OutComes

- The ideal outcome is that the user can switch between "rooms" to view different
artworks and their descriptions. The user then can leave a review right before they 
exit the program.
