## Description 
This project is an interactive art gallery. Users can move through the different rooms to
look at different artworks and see a brief description of the pieces. The user can look at
six different artworks spread across three different rooms.

Three types of files are included in the repository. The first is the Python file('project.py')
of the code for the interactive art gallery. The second type of file is six jpg files that are 
the artworks that will be seen through the program: Girl With a Pearl Earring, 
Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, The Kiss, The Scream, Mona Lisa, 
and The Starry Night. The last file is a text file('artworks.txt') that includes the path of
the jpg, the name of the artwork, the artist, and a brief description of the pieces.

The program's design is simple, with only two artworks on the screen. Text is stated below
for each artwork for the user to click on to find more information about the artwork. There
is also text at the top of the screen with the program's name and the room the user is
currently in.

Some areas of improvement would be the style of the program. While it is straightforward and gets
the point across of the program, it's plain and has a little personality that states it's a digital 
art gallery. I would change the background and add more visual design details like frames or a small 
plaque to draw more visual intrigue. The other improvement needed is the way that the text box appears.
While clicking the text brings up information about the art piece, the text box will still appear if 
you click anywhere around the piece. So, I would continue altering the program so that the information 
appears only if the user clicks the text.
